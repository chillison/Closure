/**
 * Closure KB hybrid retrieval (ADR-3 / VS1 R4/AC4).
 *
 * Fuses a structured pre-filter + FTS5 bm25 + vec0 KNN via Reciprocal Rank
 * Fusion (RRF, k=60) in a single SQL query (Alex Garcia CTE pattern, research
 * `hybrid-retrieval-sqlite-vec-research.md` §1/§3), then returns parent-doc
 * entries (name + body_text from closure_entry).
 *
 * KEY ADAPTATION vs the research template: the canonical pattern JOINs FTS and
 * vec by `rowid`. That does NOT apply here - closure_entry has a TEXT PRIMARY
 * KEY (its implicit rowid is the FTS external-content linkage key, not a stable
 * join id). All three tables are JOINed by `entry_id` (TEXT): entry_fts.entry_id
 * (UNINDEXED but SELECTable), entry_vec.entry_id (PK), closure_entry.entry_id
 * (PK). FULL OUTER JOIN (SQLite 3.39+, bundled by better-sqlite3 3.53+) keeps
 * FTS-only and vec-only matches alive through fusion.
 *
 * Offline / best-effort degradation (design §2): no embedding model, embed
 * endpoint failure, dim mismatch, or sqlite-vec not loaded -> the vector arm is
 * skipped ENTIRELY and the query degrades to FTS5 + structured pre-filter + RRF
 * (single-arm). An empty/unsanitizable query + no vector -> structured-only
 * fallback (closure_entry by project/type, score 0). This graceful degradation
 * is the default-robust path, never an afterthought.
 *
 * Story 8.7 dual-vector retrieval (design §3.2): the vec arm runs KNN over ALL
 * entry_vec rows (#body full-text vectors + #identity name/type/summary vectors
 * live in the same table — kind is NEVER filtered, 双臂齐搜 is the user's call).
 * The KNN pool is deduped to each entry's BEST (nearest) row, and that row's
 * vector_kind becomes the hit's `vectorKind` ('identity' = "what it is" match /
 * 'body' = content-semantic match — the consumer LLM triages). One entry = one
 * vec rank, so the RRF fusion stays per-doc.
 *
 * Story 8.3: (a) chunk vectors (`vector_kind='chunk'`, one row per chapter
 * chunk entry — the indexer writes vector_id = entry_id) join the same KNN
 * pool. Each chunk entry owns exactly ONE vector row, so the per-entry dedupe
 * keeps chunks ranked PER CHUNK (same-chapter multi-chunk hits each hold a
 * result slot — paragraph-level provenance, not a merged chapter slot; the
 * body/identity/chunk kinds coexist without conflict). Chapter-source hits
 * carry chapterId + span fields for 段级出处 (8.4 调查简报消费). (b) CR-005
 * structural fix: `status`/`visibility` are now entry_vec METADATA columns
 * (S1 DDL) — they pre-prune the KNN candidates exactly like entry_type, and
 * the final closure_entry WHERE belt stays as double insurance. The 8.7
 * vecK-x2/x4 compensation is retired (see buildRrfQuery).
 *
 * The module is the shared retrieval core for both the human command bar and
 * the AI `query_story` function call (design §8 downstream interface). The IPC
 * channel + agent tool are wired in VS1 阶段5 (scope fence: this module adds
 * neither).

 * - FTS5 `row_number() OVER (ORDER BY rank)` assigns rn over ALL matches before
 *   `LIMIT`; the statement-level `ORDER BY rank LIMIT ?` makes the limit
 *   deterministic and consistent with rn (best topN -> rn 1..topN).
 * - vec0 `k = ?` caps the vec candidates to the nearest rows. Story 8.7
 *   dual-vector: k counts VECTOR ROWS and a long doc occupies two (#body +
 *   #identity), so the row budget is doubled to hold the distinct-entry pool at
 *   topN after the per-entry dedupe below (recall parity with the single-vector
 *   era; vec0 brute-force makes a larger k ~zero marginal cost). Chapter chunk

 * the module's "vec unavailable -> degrade to FTS + structured + RRF" promise
 * (docstring above) hold at RUNTIME, not just at BUILD time (qVec=null -> Case 2).
 *
 * Returns true ONLY when the failed query had BOTH a vec arm AND an FTS arm:
 * - vec + fts (Case 1 failed) -> retry FTS-only (Case 2). TRUE.
 * - vec-only (Case 3, no FTS arm) -> an FTS-only retry has nothing to run. FALSE.
 * - fts-only already (Case 2 failed) -> retrying the SAME query throws identically. FALSE.
 * - structured-only (Case 4, no arms) -> no FTS arm. FALSE.
 *
 * Extracted from `searchClosure` so the retry DECISION is unit-testable in plain
 * vitest (the DB-execution path itself skips under plain vitest on ABI mismatch).
