**Closure** is an open-source, local-first AI novel-writing IDE for fiction and web-novel authors. It brings outlines, chapters, characters, and world-building asset cards into one workspace. Built on a "user-led, AI-assisted" principle, it offers AI generation, continuation, polishing, review, and controlled edits, connects to any OpenAI-compatible model, and keeps all of your writing on your own computer. It runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Closure is licensed AGPL-3.0-or-later (OrisonSpace-derived code retains Apache-2.0).

## Features

- **Full-pipeline creation** — Outlines, chapters, and asset cards in one workspace
- **AI-assisted** — Generate, continue, polish, review, and make controlled edits; user-led, AI-assisted
- **Local-first** — Project files live on your machine; data never leaves your computer
- **Agent orchestration** — Skills / Workflows / nested sub-agents; LLM auto-invokes tools
- **Image generation + editing** — Text-to-image, local editing (brush/mask/crop), results go straight to asset library
- **Version control** — isomorphic-git-based commit nodes, branches, diffs, and timeline
- **IDE-style editor** — Split view, minimap, multi-tab, command palette
- **Document interop** — DOCX preview, import, and export for chapters/outlines
- **Themes & i18n** — Light/dark/custom themes, Chinese & English, YAML-driven and extensible
- **Model freedom** — Connect any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, manage API keys locally

> **Experimental features:** Agent Orchestration (multi-step pipelines), Auto Mode (auto-advance), and video generation are currently experimental and not guaranteed to be stable. Production-ready versions will land in future releases.

## Who it's for

- **Web-novel & long-form fiction authors** — who want outlines, chapters, and character bibles to live in one workspace instead of scattered across documents
- **Writers who want AI without giving up control** — Closure is a creative workspace, not a one-shot generator: every AI edit is previewable, controllable, and reversible
- **People who value privacy and data ownership** — your work is stored as local files, never uploaded, no account required
- **Bring-your-own-model users** — plug in your own OpenAI-compatible API key and freely choose text and image models

## Download

> Currently in Alpha — under active development.

The release repository is coming soon (GitHub release prep) — once the repo is live, installers will be available on GitHub Releases:

| Platform | Format |
|----------|--------|
| Windows | `.exe` installer / portable `.zip` |
| macOS | `.dmg` disk image |
| Linux | `.AppImage` portable executable |

## Status

**Alpha** — Core creative pipeline (novel chapter generation/continuation/review, image generation, Agent orchestration) is functional. UI and features are being actively refined.

## FAQ

**What is Closure?**
An open-source, local-first AI novel-writing IDE that brings outlines, chapters, characters, and world-building asset cards into one workspace, with AI generation, continuation, polishing, review, and controlled edits.

**How is it different from a chat tool like ChatGPT?**
It's a workspace for long-form writing, not a one-shot generator. Project structure, a version timeline, and an asset library persist over time; every AI edit is previewable, controllable, and reversible, and the user always leads the creation.

**Is my writing uploaded to the cloud?**
No. Closure is local-first. Your work is saved as plain files (`project.yaml`, `chapters/*.md`, etc.) on your own computer, with no account required and no data leaving your machine.

**Which AI models are supported?**
Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. You connect with your own API key and freely choose text and image models; keys are stored encrypted, locally only.

**Which operating systems are supported?**
Windows, macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon), and Linux.

**Is it free? Is it open source?**
Fully open source under AGPL-3.0-or-later (OrisonSpace-derived code retains Apache-2.0) and free to use. You only bring your own model API usage.
